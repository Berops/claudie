In Claudie, the Hetzner cloud provider requires you to input the credentials in the `credentials` field. This field contains the API token for your Hetzner project. The API key should have `Read & Write` permissions.

To find out how you can create an API token please follow instructions [here](https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/api/getting-started/generating-api-token/).
