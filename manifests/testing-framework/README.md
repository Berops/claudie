## Testing Framework 

`testing-framework` is a custom service used to run tests by applying some pre-defined manifest and monitor the cluster creation process and their health after successful creation.

Please make sure you use the testing framework **only** for development purposes. \
You almost certainly don't want to deploy the testing framework as a regular user.
