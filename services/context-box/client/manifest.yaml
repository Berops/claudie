# NOTES:
# Please consider this as a very barebones, incomplete design, that can however be extended arbitrarily. The API version lifecycle can work similarly to how K8s manifests work.
# The input config will to undergo a lot of validation - e.g. are credentials correct? are the provided machinePool IPs reachable, and do the ssh keys work?
# Security must be extremely tight - the config contains extremely sensitive data
# Can we support "machinePool" with private IPs somehow? Not all on-premise machines are going to have public IPs
# Open question - if e.g. an on-premise node or a cloud provider doesn't respond, how far should we go to try to satisfy the requested architecture of the cluster?
# There are tons of things that will need to be discussed/planned - e.g. availability domains, and similar stuff.
